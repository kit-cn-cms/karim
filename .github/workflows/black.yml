# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the dev_nanoAOD branch
  # 'paths' variable will only select python files
  # FIXME: this needs to be updated if python3 is available on other branches
  push:
    branches: [ dev_nanoAOD ]
    paths:
      - "**.py"
  pull_request:

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "lint"

    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      # Use the 'black' package as linter to enforce coding style
      - uses: psf/black@stable
